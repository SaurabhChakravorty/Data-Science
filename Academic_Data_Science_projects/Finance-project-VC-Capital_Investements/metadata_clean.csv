The company was originally founded in 2007, and it has since experienced significant growth in recent years. This is partially due to its proven approaches to helping the victims of mental illnesses and patients struggling with addiction. In particular, AAC uses research-driven treatment methodologies that have proven to be highly effective for treating drug dependence, chronic alcoholism, and behavioral health concerns. In a drive to capitalize on its recent successes, AAC aims to continue expanding to open new treatment centers while further improving the quality of its services. Founded by an Experienced Team Michael Cartwright, a mental health practitioner with over 20 years of experience, founded AAC in 2007 with the mission of helping adult patients by providing high-quality and compassionate care. His participation in supervising 15 federally funded studies on mental illness had taught him that there were broad areas of the mental health field that were entirely unaddressed. Cartwright saw an especially significant need among patients with co-occurring mental disorders, and he aimed to position his company to address these issues through all available means. Cartwright experienced his own struggles that he had overcome by the beginning of his professional career. Drawing from this personal experience, he knew that co-occurring disorders were a severe issue that most treatment providers ignore. For instance, many patients who have depression often turn to alcoholism, and this, in turn, can later lead to a further spiral of descent. AAC was founded with the mission of helping patients with co-occurring disorders to return to normal life and to get out of what can seem like an impossible trap. Over time, AAC learned highly effective approaches to helping patients with co-occurring disorders and related difficulties, and it consequently expanded rapidly in the years following its initial founding. Facilities Across the U.S. AAC was founded with the understanding that it would be a national company that would focus on the geographical markets that are in the greatest need of its services. As a result, the company decided to open its headquarters in Tennessee, a state where it does not have any treatment centers but where its executive team can remain close to its other treatment centers across the country. Overall, AAC has treatment centers in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Florida, and California. In future years, AAC will continue to move into new markets as additional opportunities are uncovered in the marketplace and as more funding becomes available. A Publicly Traded Company In the mental health field, most providers are small local companies that lack the resources of a national network. American Addiction Centers, on the other hand, takes a more growth-oriented approach that focuses on leveraging the expertise available across all of its locations. In today's data-driven economy, AAC has significant scale advantages that its competitors do not have, and it is better able to address a national audience that often finds providers through the internet. Consequently, AAC made the decision to become the first provider in the addiction treatment industry to become publicly traded. With a more visible profile and better access to capital, the company has been able to grow in ways that its competitors have been unable to match. New Treatment Centers Shortly after going public, AAC made the decision to begin acquiring companies that match its general strategy. In December 2014, the company took over Recovery First, a substance abuse company based in Florida, for $13 million. The treatment center in Fort Lauderdale owned by Recovery First was already generating $7 million per year in revenue, and it was near two other facilities that AAC owned in Florida at the time. AAC also made investments in other treatment centers across the U.S. in subsequent years. A Focus on Raising Awareness Additionally, the company acquired two digital marketing companies, Taj Media and Referral Solutions Group, in 2015. Digital marketing expertise helped AAC to increase its visibility among patients looking for solutions online. A focus on digital marketing also led AAC to begin leveraging Michael Cartwright's expertise in conducting research studies that could be published online to increase visibility. Many of the studies that the company has since published have led to advancements that have significantly helped mental health patients while aiding them toward discovering new treatment options. AAC's Unique Approach AAC applies an interventional approach that focuses on using all interpersonal resources in a patient's life, such as family, coworkers, and friends, to encourage successful treatment. Most people are ultimately driven by the social pressures in their lives, so interventional medicine can help patients on a day-to-day basis to get the help they would not be able to get on their own. AAC's interventional approaches can also help family members who have been struggling to get a loved one to seek the assistance they need. The company can send a treatment specialist out to a patient's home in an attempt to encourage the individual to seek help, and it can also contact the patient over the phone. By working holistically to address the human side of addiction treatment, AAC has been able to realize more success than conventional providers. Veterans Addiction Study In 2019, American Addiction Centers received significant media coverage for creating ""Veteran Mental Health and Substance Abuse in America,"" a study on the mental health of U.S. veterans. The study found that binge drinking among veterans had increased significantly in the period between 2013 and 2017. Moreover, the study also found that drunk driving was also on the rise among veterans. With millions of veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and other severe issues, the groundbreaking study was important for helping to bring attention to struggling veterans who are often ignored. Services Tailored to Veterans After releasing its study, AAC increased its focus on helping veterans to get the mental health treatment that they need. For veterans, AAC uses a compassionate approach that is focused on getting patients lasting results. Veterans with PTSD are particularly difficult to help because many of them have been struggling for over 20 years, and they have often failed repeatedly to find a solution. AAC has medical staff dedicated specifically to veterans, and these staff members are encouraged to conduct their own research while on the job. Consequently, the company has been able to discover innovative approaches to helping veterans that are not practiced by other providers in the industry. Far From Finished Documentary In a further attempt to raise awareness, American Addiction Centers launched ""Far From Finished,"" a new series of documentaries that offer an in-depth view of how struggling patients are able to recover from severe mental health issues. For instance, one episode of the series follows a 14-year-old drug user named Dominic Grefsrud. Although Grefsrud was very young at the time when the documentary was filmed, he had already used methamphetamine, alcohol, and other illicit drugs. Unfortunately, his addiction eventually led to him turning to dealing drugs in an attempt to get the funds to buy the substances that he needed. With the help of AAC, Grefsrud was able to return to normal life before the substances were able to destroy his future. The series by AAC was released for free on its Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts.",,108,,,,,,,Post-IPO Debt,12000000.0,USD,12000000.0,2020-01-30,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"2,725,894",82.38%,22.86%,55,-22.95%,1.2%,AAC,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/american-addiction-centers-ipo--f390e51b,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange,,,,75000000.0,USD,75000000.0,2015-07-03,,,,,,,,,American Addiction Centers is a national behavioral healthcare provider focused on addiction treatment and rehabilitation.,,0,17,,Medical services; veterinary services,28.0,,http://twitter.com/AAC_Tweet,http://americanaddictioncenters.org/,http://www.facebook.com/AmericanAddictionCenters,http://www.linkedin.com/company/american-addiction-centers,contactaac@contactaac.com,Southern US,US,AAC-US,"AAC Holdings, Inc.",2015-07-05,2015-12-30,2014-10-02,2015-07-05,2016-01-01,AACH-OTC,-0.5740782,0.0,-0.9949720999999999,0.0

This is because they believe in connecting individuals and businesses together through social media and technology, with a view to enriching their society. The rise of social media has given new power to individuals to express their own personality through dialogue, and by developing a network of contacts on the internet it has dramatically improved the ease communication. Furthermore, businesses can now connect with their existing and prospective customers more easily through official social media accounts. In previous generations, small shops and businesses dealt directly with their customers. This brought people together, with close and direct connection being necessary to ensure complete customer satisfaction. Even though it helped to build strong relationships in the community, it did not go any further. However, the advancement of technology and the emergence of social media has broken down boundaries and upended traditional hierarchies that previously may have constrained the flow of transactions between individuals and businesses around the world. Businesses can now achieve various objectives, such as reducing the time and cost and for disseminating information, having essential communications, pursuing research and development through consumer dialogue and preventing marketing mistakes.

The approach is based on the identification of target genes, such as H19, that are expressed only in cancerous tumors, and not in healthy cells, and on the use of those genes' regulatory sequences for the activation of a toxin inside the cancerous cells only, thus destroying them without harming healthy cells. BioCancell's leading drug candidate, BC-819, has completed a Phase IIb clinical trial for the treatment of bladder cancer, as well as additional clinical trials for other cancer indications.

The system represents a generational change from current methods such as labels (hand‑written and pre‑printed), barcodes (linear and 2D) and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). ​The bluechiip system uses a patented and highly miniaturised smart chiip that enables the bluechiip® chain‑of‑custody system. Every time a smart chiip is read, an instantaneous temperature is measured, time stamped and recorded. This allows an accurate temperature history to be recorded to provide a more complete chain of custody. The smart chiip will survive and operate in extreme temperature environments such as cryogenic storage and gamma irradiation making it suitable for biobank applications. The smart chiip is a passive device based on MEMS technology that contains no electronics and is either embedded or manufactured into cryogenic storage equipment such as vials, cassettes (canisters), racks and towers or liquid nitrogen tanks. The smart chiip has advantages over more traditional identification technologies that have significant limitations e.g. Where a barcode requires a visible tag or line‑of‑sight optical scan, bluechiip® technology does not; and unlike labels, barcodes and RFID, the bluechiip® technology can sense the temperature and ID of each individual biosample a smart chiip is attached to or embedded in. The bluechiip® technology has initial applications in the healthcare industry particularly those businesses which require cryogenic storage facilities (biobanks and biorepositories).

Builders FirstSource was born from this industry evolution. In March 1998, the Company’s management team, with the backing of JLL Partners, a private investment firm with significant committed capital, made its first acquisition.  Builders FirstSource continued to grow through a combination of strategic acquisitions and internal expansion.  Between 1998 and the beginning of 2015, we acquired and integrated thirty-three companies.  In June 2005, Builders FirstSource completed an initial public offering of its common stock, after which JLL Partners maintained a significant investment in the company.   On July 31, 2015, Builders FirstSource acquired its largest competitor, ProBuild Holdings LLC, creating a more diversified company with enhanced scale and improved geographic footprint.

The C-Pulse Heart Assist System is designed to treat clinical symptoms associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure, sometimes also referred to as moderate and severe failure.  Patients associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure are typically unable to engage in normal activities, compromising their quality of life. The C-Pulse System uses proven balloon counter-pulsation technology to assist the heart by reducing the workload of the left ventricle. During inflation of the balloon, blood flow is increased to the coronary arteries, thereby providing additional oxygen which is vital to a failing heart. During deflation, the workload, or pumping required by the left heart is reduced. The balloon inflation and deflation is synchronized to the patient’s heartbeat, similar to a pacemaker.   Potential benefits of the technology are relief of shortness of breath, increased physical activity, improved cardiac function, enhanced mobility and improved quality of life.

Over 350 people have received CMX001 to date, with a growing body of evidence supporting the drug's antiviral activity in humans. Clinical studies of CMX001 include an ongoing Phase 2 study of the prevention/control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-201), a Phase 2 study being initiated for the treatment of adenovirus (AdV) infection in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-202), and an Open-Label Study (CMX001-350) for the treatment of any of 12 different dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, herpes viruses such as CMV, herpes simplex virus and Epstein Barr virus, polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus, and pox viruses. The Open-Label Study builds on Chimerixâ€™s extensive experience working with clinicians at over 55 leading institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel who have sought CMX001 for the treatment of more than 150 immunocompromised patients under Emergency INDs. CMX001 has been well tolerated in all studies. CMX001 is also being developed as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. Chimerix has received significant federal funding for the development of CMX001 as a medical countermeasure against smallpox from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Chimerix's second clinical-stage antiviral compound, CMX157, a potent nucleoside analogue with in vitro activity against HIV and hepatitis B, has the potential to directly address several limitations of current HIV therapies. Chimerix is developing CMX157 for the treatment of HIV infection including those caused by multi-drug resistant viruses. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed demonstrating that the compound is well tolerated and that the active antiviral, TFV-PP, was measurable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after a single dose and remained detectable for six days, indicating that it may be suitable for once-weekly dosing. Led by a world-class antiviral drug development team, Chimerix is also leveraging the company's extensive chemical library to pursue new treatments for hepatitis C virus, flu, malaria and other global public health needs.",,79,,,,,,,Venture - Series Unknown,34900000.0,USD,34900000.0,2019-07-31,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"2,866",50.35%,15.43%,74,145.16%,-7.2%,CMRX,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/chimerix-ipo--a32d18b0,NASDAQ,341600000.0,USD,341600000.0,102000000.0,USD,102000000.0,2013-04-19,"National Institutes of Health, Canaan Partners, Morningside Group, Frazier Healthcare Partners, Alta Partners",,,,,,,,Chimerix is a biotechnology company developing therapeutics for antiviral diseases.,For Profit,25,5,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,"Pharmaceutical, veterinary and sanitary products",16.0,,http://twitter.com/chimerix,http://www.chimerix.com,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chimerix/162986147053041,http://www.linkedin.com/company/chimerix-inc.,info@chimerix-inc.com,"Research Triangle, East Coast, Southern US",US,CMRX-US,"Chimerix, Inc.",2013-04-21,2013-10-16,2013-04-11,2013-04-21,2013-10-18,CMRX-NAS,-0.10626995,0.0,-0.9102019,0.0

Covata reduces the risk of data compromise from doing business over untrusted networks and devices.  Covata gives organizations the confidence to share data beyond the domain via ad hoc relationships with customers or partners, or realize the business benefits of technology like the cloud and mobility.  At Covata we call this “own your data” - securing data at the point of origination so it is protected wherever it resides.  The Covata Platform enables organizations to protect sensitive data through encryption, to control that data through granular, persistent data rights management, and to view all access activity for the protected data.    Vendors who appreciate the business value of data-centric security are faced with the classic buy-versus-build strategic question: develop their own encryption platform or incorporate an existing set of capabilities.  Covata ends the debate with a solution built from the ground up to be an extensible, services-based platform that is readily integrated into user workflows.  The flexible Covata platform easily adapts to varying operating environments and implementation scenarios, freeing critical development resources to focus on delivering the application or service rather than designing, developing and deploying security functions.",,42,,,,,,,Post-IPO Equity,6900000.0,USD,6900000.0,2015-11-23,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,466,39.69%,-68.5%,11,-91.81%,-23.72%,CVT,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/covata-ipo--ce08dfcf,ASX - Australian Securities Exchange,,,,,,,2007-01-12,"Asia Principal Capital, Foster Stockbroking",,,,,,,,Covata provides data-centric security platform that enables businesses to integrate data-centric security into applications and products.,For Profit,,,,,17.0,1.0,http://twitter.com/Covata,http://www.covata.com,,http://www.linkedin.com/company/covata,info@covata.com,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Australasia",AU,CVT-AU,Cipherpoint Ltd,2007-01-14,2007-07-11,2007-01-03,2007-01-14,2007-07-13,CPT-ASX,1.0754719,1.0,-0.9984304,0.0

UWM is a world-renowned leader in stem cell research, in particular for the work by Professor James Thomson's group, which included the first successful isolation of human embryonic stem cells in 1998, and the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human adult cells in 2007. Professor Igor Slukvin, a co-founder of Cynata, was also a member of the team that conducted UWM's pioneering iPSC research. Cynata's Cymerus™ platform stem cell technology is based upon extremely important and versatile stem cells known as mesenchymoangioblasts (MCAs). MCAs are a precursor of mesenchymal stem (or stromal) cells (MSCs) which are at the forefront of a new generation of treatments being investigated for such devastating diseases as osteoarthritis, Crohn’s disease and heart disease. Cynata’s proprietary technology utilizes iPSCs originating from an adult donor as the starting material for generating MCAs and in turn for manufacturing the MSC therapeutic product. Cynata will use the proprietary Cymerus™ technology to address a critical shortcoming in existing methods of production of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for therapeutic use, which is the ability to achieve economic manufacture at commercial scale. This opens up a wide range of therapeutic and manufacturing possibilities for the Company. The Cymerus™ technology has several characteristics which makes it ideal for the development of cell-based therapeutics. Most critically, the Cymerus™ manufacturing process ensures that cells for therapeutic use can be produced in virtually limitless quantities. This means that Cynata will not have to constantly seek out fresh stem cell donors to fuel its manufacturing demands. This has the potential to create a new standard in the emergent arena of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapeutics and provides Cynata with both a unique differentiator and an important competitive position.",,5,,,,,,,Post-IPO Equity,5200000.0,AUD,3936507.0,2018-05-30,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,580,43.64%,36.41%,111,-34.19%,20.09%,CYP,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/cynata-ipo--1116d2e8,ASX - Australian Securities Exchange,,,,,,,2007-12-28,Fidelity International,,,,,,,,Cynata is a life sciences technology business.,For Profit,,,,,11.0,,https://www.twitter.com/cynatastemcells,http://cynata.com,https://www.facebook.com/cynatatherapeutics,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cynata-therapeutics,info@automic.com.au,"Asia-Pacific (APAC), Australasia",AU,CYP-AU,Cynata Therapeutics Limited,2007-12-30,2008-06-25,2007-12-20,2007-12-30,2008-06-27,CYP-ASX,-0.63636364,0.0,-0.7739235,0.0

The company offers consumers financial products and services through  retailer locations including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, Rite Aid, Kmart, Kroger, 7-ELEVEN, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Smiths and Radio Shack. Green Dot's products include Green Dot MasterCard® and Visa® branded prepaid debit cards and the Green Dot MoneyPak® - a cash processing gateway that provides a way for consumers to load cash to prepaid cards, use cash to make purchases and pay bills, and add cash to a variety of accounts including PayPal.  Green Dot is a leading prepaid financial services company providing simple, low-cost and convenient money management solutions to a broad base of U.S. consumers. They believe that they are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States and that their Green Dot Network is the leading prepaid reload network in the United States. They sell their cards and offer their reload services nationwide at approximately 50,000 retail store locations, which provide consumers convenient access to their products and services. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, provides essential functionality, including point-of-sale connectivity and interoperability with Visa, MasterCard and other payment or funds transfer networks, and compliance and other capabilities to their Green Dot Network, enabling real-time transactions in a secure environment. The combination of their innovative products, broad retail distribution and proprietary technology creates powerful network effects, which they believe enhance the value they deliver to their customers, retail distributors and other participants in their network.   They were an early pioneer in the development of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, or GPR cards, and associated reload services, which collectively they refer to as prepaid financial services. GPR cards are designed for general spending purposes and can be used anywhere the cards' applicable payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, is accepted, but, unlike gift cards, can be reloaded with additional funds for ongoing, long-term use. Their GPR cards are issued as Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards and are accepted worldwide by merchants and other businesses belonging to the applicable payment network, including for bill payments, online shopping, everyday store purchases and ATM withdrawals. They believe that they are the leading provider of GPR cards in the United States based on the 3.4 million active cards in their portfolio as of March 31, 2010, which they define as cards that have had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period.   They have built strong distribution and marketing relationships with many significant retail chains, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Kroger, K-Mart, Meijer and Radio Shack. These retail chains provide consumers with convenient locations to purchase and reload their cards. In addition, any holder of a GPR card issued by a member of their reload network may reload that card at any one of those locations. Currently, there are over 100 third-party prepaid card programs that use their nationwide reload network to facilitate reloading by their cardholders. In 2009, they entered into an agreement with PayPal whereby its customers can add funds to any new or existing PayPal account through their reload network at all retail locations where they sell their products and services, but to date they have not generated significant operating revenues from their relationship with PayPal. In fiscal 2009, the gross dollar volume loaded to their GPR card and reload products was $4.7 billion, an increase of 67% over fiscal 2008.   They have developed a business model with powerful network effects. Growth in the number of their product and service offerings or their network participants, which include consumers, retail distributors and businesses that accept reloads or payments through the Green Dot Network, enhances the value they deliver to all network participants. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, enables network participants to communicate and complete transactions rapidly and securely through their reload network or third-party payment or funds transfer networks, and is a central component of their network-based business model.",,53,,,,,,,Private Equity,,,,2009-11-01,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"3,029,157",37.28%,-9.56%,291,2.27%,0.78%,GDOT,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/green-dot-corporation-ipo--25b30ec1,NYSE - New York Stock Exchange,,,,164000000.0,USD,164000000.0,2010-07-22,"Sequoia Capital, TCV, Tech Coast Angels, Kenneth Leiter",,,,,,,,Green Dot Corporation provides retail-based financial services for businesses and money management solutions for consumers based in the U.S.,For Profit,12,62,Electric Communication Technique,Insurance; financial affairs,32.0,1.0,http://twitter.com/greendotcards,http://www.greendot.com,http://www.facebook.com/GreenDot,https://www.linkedin.com/company/green-dot-corporation,,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",US,GDOT-US,Green Dot Corporation Class A,2010-07-24,2011-01-18,2010-07-22,2010-07-24,2011-01-20,GDOT-NYS,0.37828052999999995,1.0,-0.31742085,0.0

The Company’s current focus is in the area of acute cardiovascular care, a market served by its commercial product, AGGRASTAT (tirofiban HCl). The Company is also looking to develop and acquire additional hospital products. To accomplish this, the Company is leveraging its historical expertise in clinical development as well as exploring acquisition opportunities with growth potential. Medicure was established in 1997, and spent its first decade focused on research and development. In 2008, the Company began a transition to focus on its commercial, specialty pharmaceutical business. This new direction was solidified in October 2013 with the U.S. FDA approval of the new label for AGGRASTAT. The label change has provided a basis for the Company to grow sales and achieve profitability, and also to pursue development and acquisition opportunities. Medicure’s board and management is committed to building value for its existing shareholder base and is patiently pursuing a long-term view to establishing the Company as a leading, international pharmaceutical company - one that is distinguished by its unique fit within the contemporary market. Medicure Inc. is based in Winnipeg, Canada and publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture under the symbol MPH. Its subsidiaries include Medicure International, Inc.

MEG has acquired a large, high-quality resource base – one that they believe holds some of the best in situ resources in Alberta. With these resources and a well-formulated strategic growth plan, MEG is positioned to be a strong oil sands player for many years to come. MEG also owns interests in two key midstream assets: Access Pipeline and Stonefell Terminal. Access Pipeline, a 50%-owned joint venture with Devon Energy, connects their Christina Lake Project to a main transportation hub in Edmonton, ultimately providing access for their product to multiple end markets. Stonefell Terminal, is a wholly-owned 900,000 barrel storage facility that was completed in late 2013. It allows MEG to mitigate risks with pipeline restrictions and acquire and store diluent during favourable market conditions. A proprietary pipeline connects Stonefell Terminal to the Canexus Bruderheim rail facility, establishing the first wellhead to unit train connection via pipeline in Canada. Together, these assets provide MEG with a number of unique cost and revenue advantages that allow us to add significant value to each barrel they produce. MEG continually seeks opportunities to incorporate technologies that can strengthen their marketing options and develop additional opportunities. These include their Diluent Removal Facility and HI-Q® demonstration project. In 2013, MEG announced plans to construct a diluent removal facility that will be connected to Stonefell Terminal. This technology will recycle diluents needed to move their heavy crude by rail and return them to their Christina Lake project via the Access Pipeline. The resulting product “railbit”, can be transported by rail to refining markets across the continent. MEG’s proprietary HI-Q® technology has been successfully demonstrated on a smaller scale to modify bitumen blends to a product suitable for shipping by pipeline without diluent, at significantly reduced environmental impacts relative to conventional oil sands upgrading processes. In 2014, MEG commenced construction of the HI-Q® Field Demonstration Pilot. As part of their overall marketing efforts, these technologies are focused on reducing both their diluent requirements and their transportation costs.  Guiding the development of their resource base and strategic plans is a highly experienced team. Their company is home to some of the industry’s top talent, boasting decades of experience that span nearly every thermal oil sands project developed in Alberta over the past 20 years. They hire individuals who share their commitment to excellence in all that they do and those who are passionate about responsible energy development.",,59,,,,,,,Grant,10000000.0,USD,10000000.0,2018-06-01,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"6,265",55.02%,1.21%,58,-26.88%,3.58%,MEG,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/meg-energy-ipo--97359e25,TSX - Toronto Stock Exchange,,,,,,,2010-08-06,"Warburg Pincus, Canadian Government",,,,,,,,MEG Energy is a Canadian oil sands company focused on sustainable in situ development and production in the southern Athabasca oil sands.,For Profit,17,6,"Petroleum, Gas Or Coke Industries; Technical Gases Containing Carbon Monoxide; Fuels; Lubricants; Peat",Non-metallic building materials,13.0,,,http://www.megenergy.com,,,advertising@megenergy.com,,CA,MEG-CA,MEG Energy Corp.,2010-08-08,2011-02-02,2010-07-29,2010-08-08,2011-02-04,MEG-TSE,0.41322826,1.0,-0.8242519,0.0

Pharmaceutical companies face increasingly difficult choices in the allocation of internal resources to their drug development programs.  With significant P&L constraints and rich pipelines it has become increasingly difficult for many companies to fully fund and advance development all of their drug candidates, especially beyond Phase 2. Mereo has been formed to take advantage of the global pharmaceutical industry's drive for creative ways to progress their clinical development pipelines.   Mereo has acquired an initial mid-late stage portfolio of three exceptionally well characterised novel products for the treatment of diseases with considerable unmet medical need from Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Each of these programmes has a comprehensive dataset for both pre-clinical and proof-of-concept clinical studies.  Additional product opportunities are under evaluation. Mereo's focus is the development of innovative medicines that have the potential to significantly transform the lives of patients suffering from rare and other specialised conditions around the world.  To do this, the Company depends on the combination of its team's expertise in selecting and acquiring product opportunities, creating value in the development pipeline and structuring creative transactions. Mereo's internal expertise is complemented by a unique partnership with a leading global CRO, ICON. Mereo combines the operational discipline and efficiency of a small company with the financial resources to conduct comprehensive clinical studies.  Mereo will rapidly progress each of the products through further value inflection points before partnering or divesting its products.

With a 20 year history as an innovator in the design and commercialization of advanced security products and devices, Nanotech's latest venture uses nanotechnology to harness the luminescence of the iridescent wings of the Blue Morpho Butterfly to develop a sophisticated new feature to fight counterfeiting.  Nanotech has developed security threads for high value documents such as bank notes, and surveillance and intelligence gathering equipment still being used today in the International Defense and Law Enforcement markets. Nanotech Security Corp's new venture brings world-class nanotechnology from Simon Fraser University (SFU) to the authentication and anti-counterfeiting market. Founded in 1984, Nanotech Security has evolved substantially, successfully implementing devices and technology in areas of criminal justice, infrared night-viewing, tracking security and forensics. In 2008, a team of researchers at SFU in British Columbia, Canada, developed a technology to use specialized nano-optics in document authentication. The technology replicates the shimmering effect of a Blue Morpho butterfly’s wings. The effect is created through the reflection and fragmentation of natural light off of a grid of nano-sized holes that make up the surface of the butterfly’s wings.

For over two decades, scientists at Hadassah Hospital's Diabetes Unit, led by Professor Hanoch Bar-On, worked to develop a technology designed to enable the oral administration of insulin to diabetics.  A medical breakthrough in 2005 laid the foundation for the founding of Oramed Pharmaceuticals, of which Hadassah remains a part owner. Professor Bar-On helped found Oramed, together with Dr. Miriam Kidron, and served as a director until his untimely death in 2006. From the time of the company’s inception, Oramed has successfully tested its technology via various animal and human studies on its two flagship products, an oral insulin capsule, ORMD-0801, and an oral exenatide (a GLP-1 Analog) capsule, ORMD-0901. Combination therapy (ORMD 0801+0901) showed promising results in pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials are expected to follow.  Oramed's unique oral delivery technology serves as a platform for other vaccines and medications currently available in injection form. The company is approached by pharmaceutical companies large and small looking to test compliance with Oramed’s technology on their product pipeline. Oramed has garnered worldwide support of prominent scientists to its scientific advisory board, a testament to its sound technology:  the former Senior VP of Pfizer, Dr. Michael Berelowitz; Prof. John Amatruda, former Senior VP of Merck and Co.; Prof. Ele Ferrannini, Past President of the EASD*; and Prof. Avram Hershko, 2004 Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry, and a leader in the field of drug delivery methods, among others. The office of the Chief Scientist of Israel has also shown its confidence in Oramed’s technology, having awarded Oramed its third consecutive grant to continue its research. Recent and promising developments at Oramed also include 5 patent approvals for its technologies in the Israeli, Japanese, Australian, and New Zealand Patent Offices. Patent approval is particularly important as it validates Oramed’s technology, establishing an international stronghold for its oral protein delivery methods. Oramed has an additional 34 pending patents and expects to see more of them approved in the future.",,28,,,,,,,Post-IPO Equity,18100000.0,USD,18100000.0,2018-07-10,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"3,612",48.91%,163.16%,69,-15.03%,5.28%,ORMP,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/oramed-pharmaceuticals-ipo--772c46c7,NASDAQ,,,,,,,2006-04-10,Hefei Tianhui Incubator of Technologies,,,,,,,,Oramed Pharmaceuticals develops proprietary Protein Oral Delivery technology for the delivery of drugs.,For Profit,,,,,13.0,,http://twitter.com/OramedPharma,http://oramed.com,https://www.facebook.com/oramed.pharmaceuticals,https://www.linkedin.com/company/oramed-pharmaceuticals-inc.,ir@oramed.com,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",US,ORMP-US,Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc.,2006-04-12,2006-10-07,2004-03-19,2006-04-12,2006-10-09,ORMP-NAS,-0.30000002,0.0,-0.6758333000000001,0.0

Pharnext is the pioneer of a new paradigm for the discovery of medicinal drugs: PLEOTHERAPY™. The R&D approach protected by Pharnext systemizes new uses of approved drugs. It is based on network pharmacology utilizing complex and extensive genomic data to identify the thousands of molecules possibly involved in a disease. From this disease molecular network, Pharnext deduces synergistic combinations of drugs already approved but for unrelated indications. These novel therapeutics called PLEODRUG™ are then developed at new optimal doses and under new formulations. They offer several key advantages: efficacy, safety, and intellectual property including several composition of matter patents already granted. The proof of concept of the PLEOTHERAPY approach was obtained with PLEODRUG PXT3003 in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) through positive and consistent Phase 2 and Phase 3 results.

We continue to break new ground with developments that are changing regenerative medicine. RTI prepares human donated tissue and animal tissue for transplantation through extensive testing and screening, precision shaping and proprietary, validated sterilization processes. These allograft and xenograft implants are used in spine, sports medicine, orthopedic, dental and other specialty surgeries. RTI’s innovations continuously raise the bar of science and safety for biologics—from being the first company to offer precision-tooled bone implants and assembled technology to maximize each gift of donation, to inventing validated sterilization processes that include viral inactivation steps. Two such processes—the BioCleanse® and Tutoplast® Tissue Sterilization Processes—sterilize tissue, are clinically successful and are scientifically proven to address donor-to-recipient disease transmission risk while preserving tissue strength and biocompatibility. These processes have a proven record of more than five million implants sterilized with zero incidence of allograft-associated infection. Allograft is tissue that has been donated upon death by the donor. RTI honors the gift of tissue donation by treating the tissue with respect, by finding new ways to use the tissue to help patients and by helping as many patients as possible from each donation.

We are an ambitious oncology-focused company, oriented towards achieving the successful registration and commercialization of our product candidates. We have a highly experienced management team with a proven track record of success in oncology drug development and we are advancing an emerging pipeline of next generation therapies that target the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. Our lead product candidate, SRA737, is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression and the DDR replication response. In cancer cells, intrinsic replication stress is induced by factors such as oncogenes (e.g., MYC or CCNE1), genetic mutations in DNA repair machinery (e.g., BRCA1 or FA), genetic mutations leading to a dysregulated cell cycle (e.g., TP53 or RAD50) or other genomic alterations. This replication stress results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability leading to an increased dependency on Chk1 for survival. Targeted inhibition of Chk1 by SRA737 may therefore be synthetically lethal to cancer cells with elevated intrinsic replication stress and have utility as a monotherapy in a range of tumor indications. The combination of SRA737 with other modalities, such as other agents that target the DDR network and certain chemotherapeutics, may also provide synergistic anti-tumor activity via a variety of potential biological mechanisms. Importantly, the oral bioavailability of SRA737 may afford greater dosing flexibility for both monotherapy and combination therapy settings than is possible with intravenously administered agents. We are pursuing an innovative development plan for SRA737, which is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. SRA737-01 is intended to evaluate SRA737’s potential to induce synthetic lethality as monotherapy, while the SRA737-02 is intended to evaluate the combination of SRA737 potentiated by subtherapeutic, low dose gemcitabine. Concurrently, we are conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR-targeted agents, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as well as with immuno-oncology therapeutics, that may guide a potential next wave of clinical development for our asset, possibly further broadening its therapeutic utility. We are also advancing SRA141, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7 kinase (Cdc7). Cdc7 is a key regulator of DNA replication and is involved in the DDR network, making it a compelling emerging target for potential treatment across a broad range of tumor types. SRA141 is currently undergoing preclinical research in preparation for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected in late 2018.

DMD is a progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal disease that affects approximately one in every 3,500 to 5,000 live male births and has an estimated prevalence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases in the United States alone. There is no cure for DMD and, for the vast majority of patients, there are no satisfactory symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments. Our lead product candidate, SGT-001, is a gene transfer under development to restore functional dystrophin protein expression in patients' muscles. Based on our preclinical program, we believe the mechanism of action of SGT-001 has the potential to slow or even halt the progression of DMD. In 2015, we began exclusively licensing the elements of the construct for SGT-001 and other elements of our gene transfer program from the University of Michigan, the University of Missouri and the University of Washington.

Titan’s principal asset is Probuphine®, the first slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride (“buprenorphine”), designed to maintain a stable, round-the-clock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment. The outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a $1.3 billion market in the U.S., and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the U.S. in 2011. This novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication, and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment, and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations. The New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA in October, 2012 seeking approval for treatment of opioid dependence. In December 2012, Titan entered into a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (“Braeburn”) that grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine® in the United States and Canada. Titan received a non-refundable up-front license fee of $15.75 million and will receive a $50 million milestone payment upon the approval of the NDA by the FDA. Additionally, Titan will be eligible to receive up to $130 million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones in the event of future NDA submissions and approvals for additional indications, including chronic pain. Titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties. Probuphine is the first product to utilize ProNeura™, a novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery technology. The ProNeura technology has the potential to be used in developing products for the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, where maintaining stable, round-the-clock blood levels of a drug can benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes. Finally, Titan is also entitled to royalty revenue of 8-10% of net sales of Fanapt® (iloperidone), an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia by Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) under a sub-license agreement based on a licensed U.S. patent that expires in October 2016 (does not include a possible six month pediatric extension). Substantially all of this future royalty revenue has been sold to Deerfield Management (“Deerfield”), a healthcare investment fund, in exchange for cash and debt considerations which have been used to advance the development of Probuphine and for general corporate purposes.",,37,,,,,,,Post-IPO Debt,10000000.0,USD,10000000.0,2017-07-27,,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"15,722",32.4%,91.31%,151,-11.34%,-7.29%,TTNP,https://www.crunchbase.com/ipo/titan-pharmaceuticals-ipo--45bc0ed9,NASDAQ,,,,,,,2015-10-01,Horizon Technology Finance,,,,,,,,Titan Pharmaceuticals develops proprietary therapeutics for the treatment of serious medical disorders.,For Profit,9,13,Medical Or Veterinary Science; Hygiene,"Pharmaceutical, veterinary and sanitary products",10.0,,https://www.twitter.com/titanpharma,http://www.titanpharm.com,,,busdev@titanpharm.com,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",US,TTNP-US,"Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",2015-10-03,2016-03-29,1996-01-18,2015-10-03,2016-03-31,TTNP-NAS,0.22820509,1.0,-0.9869231,0.0

Real-time MRI-imaging clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs during radiation treatment allowing the system to deliver radiation to the tumor accurately while delivering less radiation to healthy tissue. MRIdian®’s increased target accuracy combined with improved tumor visibility and accurate dose recording means clinicians can treat patients who would not previously have been considered radiation therapy candidates.
